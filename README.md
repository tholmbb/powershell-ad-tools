This repository contains simple PowerShell scripts I've created and actively use at work.  
Most of them are related to Active Directory and user access management tasks.

## Folder Structure

- `Standard/` – Scripts designed for use within a **single domain** environment.
- `CrossDomain/` – Scripts with the `-CD.ps1` suffix, designed for use in **cross-domain** environments.
