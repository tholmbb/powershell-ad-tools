# PowerShell AD Tools

This repository contains simple PowerShell scripts I've created and actively use at work.  
Most of them are related to Active Directory and user access management tasks.

ðŸ’¡ **Note:** Scripts with the `-CD.ps1` suffix are designed for use in cross-domain environments.  
`CD` stands for **Cross Domain**.
